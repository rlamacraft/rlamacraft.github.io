        <h2>Hello, World.</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a British software engineer working in the areas of programming laguage
          design (in particular, domain specific languages), type systems, and the
          practical applications of such technologies. I've spent some years working
          in the fin-tech sector on data modelling languages with a growing interest
          in the world of functional programming and category theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I occasionally work on programming projects - when I can find the time -
          which I mostly put up on <a href="github.com/rlamacraft">GitHub</a>.
          That is when I'm not busy baking a pie or a loaf of sourdough bread.

          My inbox is always open, so <a href="mailto:hello@rlamacraft.com?subject=hi">feel free to say hi</a>.
