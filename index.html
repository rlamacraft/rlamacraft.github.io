      <h3>Hello World.</h3>
      <p>
        For those curious, I'm a London-based software engineer working in the fin-tech sector, specialising in the development of domain-specific languages and their associated SDLC tooling.
        I'm a minimalist, a Tau enthusiast, and a believer in the importance of the Oxford comma.
      </p>

        I'm basically *that* guy who spends his weekends playing with type-driven programming languages, or his summers writing <a href="assembly.html">quicksort implementations in Assembly</a> (QuickSort is by far my favourite sorting algorithm).
        I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the potential for DSLs to be used in modernising presentation software, and implemented some text searching algorithms I were learning in the same functional Web-based language (<a href="http://rlamacraft.co.uk/StringMatching/">have a play</a>).
        Oh, and then there was that time I tried to write a <a href="wikimind.html">machine learning algorithm</a> to play the Wikipedia game. You get the idea, and there's plenty more on <a href="https://github.com/rlamacraft">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any which case, feel free to <a href="mailto:rlamacraft@gmail.com">email me</a>.
