      <h2>My Quite Timely Journey into Programming.</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitle">And why I want programming puzzle games to become a thing that cool people do.</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="content-panel">
      <p>I first learnt to program five years ago, when my ICT teacher recommended this A Level subject that I had little knowledge of: Computing. This was a time when programming was not taught to all students in the UK and before the recent explosion we've seen in games and gadgetry aimed at getting more people, especially kids, into programming. My first experience with anything that looks like programming was with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, a tool designed to introduce some of the skills required for programming to kids. I was a little old at the time to enjoy the silly and simplistic way to build animations and stories, and so didn't do much beyond building a rudimentary game of Pong, but it was this logical problem solving that got me hooked.</p>

      <p>During the spring of my first year of A Levels, where I were taught my first programming language, Pascal, the Raspberry Pi was launched. With the aim of getting more children interested in the STEM fields - to restore the glory days of the '80s and BBC Micro - the small credit-card sized computer has become one of the biggest global trends in the tech industry in recent years. Going beyond just children, it has reinvigorated technology hobbyists the world over and certainly feels like it has kickstarted a renaissance in casual computer geekery. After the success of the Raspberry Pi, the big question now is what's next?</p>

      <p>As I completed my A Levels, and I proceeded to begin a Computer Science degree, the British government was making a major overhaul of the secondary-school education system - doing away with the letter-based grading system. In the process they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/04/coding-school-computing-children-programming" target="_blank">introduced programming into the national curriculum</a> for all children, even those as young as five. Now, this was not without debate. Some saw it as a waste of time, after all how many people actually <b>need</b> to be able to program? But it is the exposure to logical thinking and computational rationale that inspires. I wish that my teachers had been able to link the mathematical theory of algebra and geometry (that I enjoyed so thoroughly that I taught myself the basics of trigonometry in an after-school class only three of us attended) with the very real application of computing. I certainly would have have joined this brilliant community so much earlier, and I'm sure many of my peers would have joined me or at the very least have understood the purposefulness of learning maths.</p>

      <p>As part of the theoretical teaching of my A Level, we had covered Assembly and Low Level Language briefly. With an attempt at using the <a href="http://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/" target="_blank">Little Man Computer</a> as a teaching device, we were taught the basics of computer architecture but the content was largely reserved for a very theoretical approach. Enough for the average programmer. Even my degree modules, which fully covered the concepts of how processing is completed at a low level: The Von Neuman Architecture, the Fetch-Execute cycle, and all that jazz, did little to build a sense of excitment and wonder at the magic that happens millions of times a second. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ" target="_blank">The raw logical operations that are able to do mathematical calculations.</a></p>

      <p>Since A Level, I have taught myself multiple languages and had many thrown at me by both my studies and my year spent working. Most high level languages and platforms; things like Python, Java, and Web Development. In fact, I spent the best part of 18 months going from never having built a single webpage to attempting to build Progressive Web Apps using an array of technologies and platforms. Simple Web Apps for controlling my Hue lamps, my own website hosted on GitHub, and a number of Chrome Extensions; all in my spare time. My colleagues largely thought I were mad, to go home and do practically the same thing at work at the weekend. And yet it is here that my passion lies. And quite frankly, I probably wouldn't have got the job had I not worked on those projects as a Computer Science degree does not make you a programmer. Not in the slightest.</p>

      <p>Now my colleagues were a mixture software developers and other business people by profession. If they don't understand how anyone could enjoy their work as a hobby then what hope do we have? It is no wonder that the industry is so homogenous; full of, and driven by, young men. How are we to get people of all ages, backgrounds, and genders involved when the prospect of writing code in one's own time - making it a hobby open to all - if we label it as a thing that nerds and geeks do? Society is increasingly driven by those who devil in the arcane arts - a two-tier between those that "get computers" and those that simply don't. Introducing programming into schools and making programming more accessible is working, but there is still much work to be done. Casual logic-based puzzle games is one place I see helping and might just be the next thing to build on growing excitement in this space.</p>

      <p>Recently, I have begun exploring lower-level langauges in a practical sense. Having decided it is about time I learnt C, the grandfather of modern programming languages, and by association dabbling in some Assembly. Now I understand that very few people have the patience for writing proper low-level code, after all there's a reason we developed higher languages than Assembly, but I think the raw logical operations make for interesting problem solving challenges. There's a certain freedom and power that comes from being able to write code that feels like it is running on the bare metal of the machine. Just something about being able to build something really cool with nothing more than a hammer and box of nails. Now if only there were games that attempted to make this more accessibleâ€¦</p>

      <p>Through Kerbal Space Program I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxJVH5TZQFY" target="_blank">Scott Manley</a>, and through Scott Manley I discovered <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/" target="_blank">TIS-100</a>. Marketed as "The Assembly Language Puzzle Game That Nobody Asked For", the quirky game developed by Zachtronics is a brilliant way to get into practical concepts of assembly. Standard instructions like "mov" and "add" are introduced in their cute manual that is friendly for programmers though perhaps a little overwhelming for novices. The game aims to get players solving simple problems, like adding integers, using a designed processing system that uses an array of concurrent units that each execute a single instructions per step. Using this it is possible to produce optimised solutions that make maximal use of concurrency. There is certainly a real challenge in trying to find the optimal solution, however, it can't be discussed without mentioning how this game only reinforces the nerdy stereotype with its retro graphics that make Minecraft look futuristic. It is certainly a game built for programmers.</p>

      <p>And then came along <A href="http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine" target="_blank">Human Resource Machine</a>, by Tomorrow Corporation. Designed with the brilliant artistic style and slightly sinister spirit of Little Inferno, the game gets players to build an algorithm that your little guy follows in order to process packages. Using the same basic logic of TIS-100, the game is far more approachable to non-programmers and yet still encompasses that raw, simplistic logic that is far more useful to the average computer user than the specifics of any language syntax. If it were up to me, this game would be taught in schools the country over. At the end of the day, teaching any specific form of programming in schools is a waste of time. The industry moves far too fast. And even if you could teach specifics that would last a long time, it would be a waste of time for the vast majority of students who are never going to write a line of code. But teaching logical problem solving might just make people realise the fun that can be had in using computers as a medium to produce cool things; even at weekends.</p>
