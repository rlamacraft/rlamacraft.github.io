      <p>This past weekend I attended my second Hackathon. <a href="http://hackkings.org/" target="_blank">HackKing's</a> is an annual 2-day event run by the <a href="http://kcl.tech/" target="_blank">Tech Society</a> of my university, <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx" target="_blank">King's College London</a>. A free event open to all; including for the first time 16 and 17 year olds, it is aimed at encouraging social, casual programming with more than a sprinkling of the entrepreneurship-startup culture. People travelling from all over the country - all over the world in some cases. The atmosphere at these events is really unlike anything else: 24 hours, through the night, up coding, working on awesome projects, and free (pretty good tasting) food. </p>

      <p>My team went in with the idea of developing a website aimed at helping flatmates finding the optimal place to live in London, given that they all have different places to commute to each day. Using <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Transport For London's</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start" target="_blank">Google's</a> APIs we designed and mostly implemented an algorithm for identify a postcode area in which one person should optimally live - which obviously is the nearest postcode area to where they work that happens to be on the same transport link.</p>

      <p>Our implementation for one person was quite simple. In order to reduce the search space, and as such reduce the number of Web requests, we decided to make a number of estimations about the general area that is likely to find the best solution. Our initial heuristic was to use postcode districts. London is divided into <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/london_postcodes.php" target="_blank">six major postcode districts</a>, and so by picking six location equidistant from the very centre of the city we could find which was easiest for our user to get to from their commute location, using tfl's API. Once we had a postcode district, we then repeated the process for all of the postcode areas in that district, finding the easiest to reach. This would then throw up the one of the centre-most areas depending on transport links because there were currently no more constraints. Then, just to be a little more specific, we calculated a list of all of the Tube stations within one kilometre of the centre of the postcode area (i.e. within walking distance) and then sorted those stations by the travel time between each and the user's commute location. For an office near Cannon Street this system advised that the user living near Whitechapel/Bethnal Green. </p>

      <p>The trouble came when trying to make this system work for multiple people. Intuitively, the first response is to find a location that is at the mid-point of the two commute locations, but this would often put the recommended location in the middle of the city - hardly the most practical solution. As we began to discuss and partially implement different strategies it quickly became clear that this kind of work is worthy of a PhD thesis. One of the hypothetical situations we had problem optimising for was if two people had commutes into opposite ends of the city; say east and west. Individually the algorithm would recommend the furthest parts of the city but in order to live together the optimal place would be at some obtuse angle; i.e living in south or north London depending where the best transport links are for their commute locations. Now, how to find the optimal place without checking all postcode areas in London became a challenge (necessary because the APIs had a rather small limit to the number of daily requests; to the point that we ran through multiple API keys). </p>

      <p>Overall it was a good two days. I learnt a lot; especially about how JavaScript's Promises are an absolute pain to work with. I would really recommend that all students who have any interest in programming - studying Computer Science or not - attend one at some point during their studies. If nothing else but to work with like-minded people on cool projects and building one's confidence with the techy underworld.</p>
