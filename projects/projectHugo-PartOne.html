        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>
          For a couple of months I've thought about getting a new alarm. A radio alarm clock and an iPad alarm and still I would fall back asleep some mornings.
          Natural light lamp seemed the way forward. Then I remembered Philip's Hue. Hence Hugo. Hue Go. Hugo. And then I bought Hue Iris. Because reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Hue works with countless apps and IFTTT. But, more importantly, it also can be programmed via a simple REST API. Here's some of my inital experimentation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-panel padding">
        <h3>The REST API</h3>
        <p>Quick bit of research discovered that Python SDKs existed, but screw that. So I wrote a python script for sending REST API calls.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">def get_request(domain, username, url):
  url = domain + '/' + username + '/' + url
  req = urllib.request.Request(url)
  response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
  return response.read().decode('ascii')

def put_request(domain, username, url, data):
  url = domain + '/' + username + '/' + url
  json_data = json.dumps(data)
  binary_data = json_data.encode('ascii')
  req = urllib.request.Request(url, binary_data)
  req.get_method = lambda: 'PUT'
  response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
  return response.read()

def post_request(domain, username, url, data):
  url = domain + '/' + username + '/' + url
  json_data = json.dumps(data)
  binary_data = json_data.encode('ascii')
  req = urllib.request.Request(url, binary_data)
  # including binary data, defaults from GET to POST
  response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
  return response.read()

def delete_request(domain, username, url):
  url = domain + '/' + username + '/' + url
  req = urllib.request.Request(url)
  req.get_method = lambda: 'DELETE'
  response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
  return response.read()
</code></pre>
        <p>When it comes to DRY, it's the thought that counts, right?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-panel padding">
        <h3>Schedules</h3>
          <p>
            The HUE system works pretty well with alarms, or schedules as they call them. Schedules are stored on the Hue Bridge, the inter-lamp communication component.
            Just send a POST request to &lt;local IP of bridge&gt;/api/&lt;username&gt;/schedules with a JSON object in the format below.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "name": "Example Schedule",
  "description": "This is an example schedule",
  "command": {
      "address": "/api/&lt;username&gt;/groups/1/action",
      "method": "PUT",
      "body": {
        "on": true
      }
  },
  "localtime": "W127/T12:00:00"
}
</code></pre>
          <p>
            At the time specified in the local time param, the command will be executed.
            The command is a standard form for executing a command on the lamps, just specify a target (group 1, above) and an effect;
            the above code turns the lamp on but hue, satursation and brightness can also be set.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few ways to specify the time, but this is the one I find most useful.
            First is a number that corresponds a set of 7 boolean flags representing the 7 days of the week.
            MTWTFSS, so 00000011 (3) would be the weekened, 01111100 (124) would be weekdays and 127 is everyday.
            Then the rest of the time is obvious: HH:MM:SS, so this alarm will execute everyday at noon.</p>
          <p>
            I then wrote a couple of wrapper functions.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-python">def get_all_schedules(domain, username):
  url = "schedules"
  return get_request(domain, username, url)

def create_schedule(domain, username, name, desc, group, action, when):
  url = "schedules"
  address = "/api/" + username + "/groups/" + group + "/action"
  params = {
      "name": name,
      "description": desc,
      "command": {
          "address": address,
          "method": "PUT",
          "body": action
      },
      "localtime": when
  }
  post_request(domain, username, url, params)

def delete_schedule(domain, username, schedule_id):
  delete_request(domain, username, "schedules/" + schedule_id)</code></pre>
      </div>

      <div class="content-panel padding">
        <h3>From JSON</h3>
        <p>
          To separate the code from the defintions of all of my alarms, I then planned out a JSON defintion.
          An array of alarms that could be loaded from a JSON file and converted to Hue schedules.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "name": "wake up",
  "desc": "weekday wakeup",
  "group": "1",
  "action": {
    "on": true,
    "hue": 6920,
    "bri": 100,
    "sat": 71,
    "transitiontime": 1200
  },
  "when": "W124/T07:00:00"
},
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Note; transition time is defined in 100s of milliseconds with the default 4. This will take 12 seconds to turn on.
          Hue, saturation and birghtness define a warm orange.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I then wrote a JSON file that defined all of the regular alarms, like getting out of bed, with some interesting colours.
          Then all if took was a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rlamacraft/ProjectHugo/blob/master/alarms.py">simple script</a> to read in the JSON objects and for each one call <code>create_schedule</code>, as defined above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and a script was needed to clean out all of the old ones, otherwise duplicates would keep piling up everytime I re-ran the script.
          To solve this, I just appened 'Hugo:' to the front of the description and deleted all schedules with description starting with 'Hugo:' before creating the new ones.
          Bit of a hack, but it works.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-panel padding">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          It still needs some tweaking and testing.
          I'm not waking up from the light alone, still being driven made by Apple's buzzing noises.
          But waking up with a dim light makes getting up so much easier.
          And this is so much cooler.
          More cool ideas to come.
