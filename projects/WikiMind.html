      <h3>The Premise</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best things about the Web is its self-referential meta-ness. Nowhere is that manifested better than in the glorious - and just ridiculous - games that use some of the Web’s most popular sources of information. These games include <a href="http://damn.dog/" target="_blank">damn.dog</a> (uses <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page" target="_blank">WikiHow</a>) and <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/" target="_blank">Geoguesser</a> (uses <a href="https://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>), but none is as brilliant and as simple as the Wikipedia game.

          As anyone who has found themselves down a Wikipedia-Rabbit-Hole at 2AM can attest, Wikipedia is a labyrinth of endless articles that link to more articles in all directions.
          Rather than getting lost in interesting things about European Royalty or Apollo Spacecraft, the Wikipedia game is predicated on navigating through the swamp from one random article to another - using as few links as possible - From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number" target="_blank">Binary Numbers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon" target="_blank">Bacon</a>, that kind of thing (Binary number → Thai numerals → Thai language → Thailand → Fish sauce → Pork → Bacon).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is real test of a general awareness of a broad array of topics; after all you might get from an article about a specific WW2 battle to a particular quantum particle.
          For humans, this plays heavily on their knowledge of the content at hand; typically of history and geography.
          However, the question is, could a computer - without such a knowledge base - be able to compete simply by being able to identify what links on a page are good to follow? Is that, on its own, a viable strategy to this game?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who tries navigating between articles, will quickly realise that a quick route is to follow links to broader topics: apple → vegetable, football → sport, that kind of thing.
          It is also clear that the links tend to be near the top of the page, occur frequently, perhaps in the sidebar.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, could a computer algorithm rank all of the links on a page by how useful they are in reaching broader topics, follow that link and repeat the process - all faster than it takes a human to decide how two topics might be related?
